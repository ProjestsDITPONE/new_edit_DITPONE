Are you using [react-native-simple-date-picker](https://github.com/cawfree/react-native-simple-date-picker)? _Don't_. It's deprecated (and overcomplicated).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Using [`npm`]():

```sh
npm install --save @cawfree/react-native-simpler-date-picker
```

Using [`yarn`]():

```sh
yarn add @cawfree/react-native-simpler-date-picker
```

## ‚úçÔ∏è Example

It's really simple, just make sure you have [moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/) installed so you can toy with the results.

```js
import SimplerDatePicker from '@cawfree/react-native-simpler-date-picker';

const App = () => (
  <SimplerDatePicker
    minDate={Moment().subtract(1, 'days')}
    maxDate={Moment().add(1, 'days')}
    onDatePicked={console.log}
  />
);

```

That's all!
